# Trade Ideas Research

## Overview
This repository serves as a collection of trade ideas based on current markets across different asset classes, primarily focused on Equity Derivatives but also including FX, Rates, and Credit markets. The ideas range from purely discretionary trades and relative value analysis to more systematic/semi-systematic strategies leveraging quantitative models.

## Objectives
The purpose of this repository is to:
- Document and track trade ideas using a structured and organized approach.
- Demonstrate analytical methods and strategies for generating alpha, despite limited access to proprietary data sources such as the Bloomberg Terminal.

## Data Access Limitations
The development of the trade ideas in this repository is subject to data availability. As access to high-quality market data and analytics tools (e.g., Bloomberg Terminal) is restricted, ideas are be based on publicly available data sources, which can limit the depth of analysis. However, the focus remains on exploring creative and robust strategies even with these constraints.


## Trade Idea Format
Each trade idea follows a consistent structure to ensure clarity and comparability. A typical trade idea file (e.g., `trade_idea_1`, `SST_1`) includes the following sections:

1. **Trade Summary:** A brief overview of the trade idea and its rationale.
2. **Market Context:** Current market conditions and key drivers.
3. **Trade Details:**
   - Asset(s) involved
   - Trade type (e.g., Arbitrage, Relative Value, Option Structure)
   - Time Horizon
4. **Risk Management:** Potential risks and hedging structures.
5. **Expected Outcome:** Payout structure.
6. **References:** References used to support the trade.
