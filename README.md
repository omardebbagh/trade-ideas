# Trade Ideas Research

## Overview
This repository serves as a collection of trade ideas based on current markets across different asset classes, primarily focused on Equity Derivatives but also including FX, Rates, and Credit markets. The ideas range from purely discretionary trades and relative value analysis to more systematic/semi-systematic strategies leveraging quantitative models.

## Objectives
The purpose of this repository is to:
- Document and track trade ideas using a structured and organized approach.
- Demonstrate analytical methods and strategies for generating alpha, despite limited access to proprietary data sources such as the Bloomberg Terminal.

## Data Access Limitations
The development of the trade ideas in this repository is subject to data availability. As access to high-quality market data and analytics tools (e.g., Bloomberg Terminal) is restricted, ideas are be based on publicly available data sources, which can limit the depth of analysis. However, the focus remains on exploring creative and robust strategies even with these constraints.
